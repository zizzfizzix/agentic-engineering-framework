# Code Review

Review code changes against the project's architecture rules, security requirements, naming conventions, and quality standards. Produce actionable, categorized findings.

## Review Workflow

1. **Scope**: Identify changed files. Classify each file by layer (API route, entity, validator, backend page, frontend page, subscriber, worker, command, search config, setup, ACL, events, DI, widget, test).
2. **Gather context**: Read relevant AGENTS.md for each touched module/package. Check the specs root (`framework.config.json` → `paths.specsRoot`) for active specs on the module. Read the project's lessons file (e.g. `.ai/lessons.md`) for known pitfalls.
3. **CI/CD verification gate (MANDATORY)**: Run the same checks that CI runs (the commands listed in `framework.config.json` → `validation`), in order. Every gate MUST pass before the review can conclude. If any gate fails, fix the issue first — do NOT mark the review as passing. See **CI/CD Verification Gate** section below.
4. **Template parity gate**: If the project ships a scaffolding template, run its template-sync check. If drift is reported, ask the user whether to sync now; if approved, run the template-sync fix command and include synced files in the change.
5. **Backward compatibility gate**: Check every change against the project's backward-compatibility contract (e.g. a `BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md` linked from root `AGENTS.md`). Flag any violation as **Critical**. See section below.
6. **Run checklist**: Apply all applicable rules from this skill's `references/review-checklist.md`. Flag violations with severity, file, line, and fix suggestion.
7. **Test coverage**: Verify changed behavior is covered by unit tests and/or integration tests. If coverage is missing, flag it with severity, file references, and exact test cases to add.
8. **Cross-module impact**: If the change touches events, extensions, or widgets, verify the consuming side handles the contract correctly.
9. **Output**: Produce the review report in the format below.

## CI/CD Verification Gate (MANDATORY)

**NEVER claim code is "ready to ship", "ready to merge", or "CI will pass" without running these checks first and confirming they all pass.** This gate mirrors exactly what CI runs on every PR to the default branch (`framework.config.json` → `git.defaultBranch`) and any long-lived integration branch. The commands to run are the project's verification gate — the list in `framework.config.json` → `validation`. If any step fails, it MUST be fixed before the review can pass.

### Gate Steps (run in order)

Run the commands listed in `framework.config.json` → `validation` and verify each one exits successfully (exit code 0). A typical gate (the commands below are one platform's examples) covers build, code-generation/prepare, i18n sync, typecheck, and tests:

| #   | Command (example)       | What it checks                                   | If it fails                                                                          |
| --- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | `yarn build:packages`   | All packages compile                             | Fix TypeScript/build errors in the changed package                                   |
| 2   | `yarn generate`         | Module auto-discovery files are up to date       | Run it — it generates missing files                                                  |
| 3   | `yarn build:packages`   | Rebuild with generated files included            | Fix any type errors exposed by generated files                                       |
| 4   | `yarn i18n:check-sync`  | All locale files + template locales are in sync  | Add missing i18n keys to all locale files                                            |
| 5   | `yarn i18n:check-usage` | No unused or missing i18n keys                   | Remove unused keys or add missing ones (if CI marks this non-blocking, still report) |
| 6   | `yarn typecheck`        | TypeScript types are correct across all packages | Fix type errors — do NOT dismiss as "pre-existing"                                   |
| 7   | `yarn test`             | All unit tests pass across all packages          | Fix failing tests — do NOT dismiss as "flaky" or "pre-existing"                      |
| 8   | `yarn build:app`        | The app builds successfully                      | Fix build errors                                                                     |

### Rules

- **Run independent gate steps (e.g. typecheck and test) in parallel** to save time.
- **Every failure is a finding**: If the typecheck or test command fails, it is a **Critical** finding in the review — even if the failure appears unrelated to the current changes. The PR will fail CI regardless of whose fault it is.
- **No excuses**: "Pre-existing on develop", "flaky test", "not our code" are not valid reasons to skip. If it fails on your branch, it will fail on CI. Fix it or flag it as a blocker.
- **Evidence required**: The review output MUST include the actual pass/fail result of each gate step. Do not assume — run the commands and report what happened.

## Frontend Performance Blocking Gate

For PRs touching framework routes, generated frontend, shared providers, backend shell UI, or heavy interactive widgets, the reviewer has blocking power for performance regressions. Request changes when any of these are true:

- a Server Component was converted to a Client Component without an accepted Frontend Architecture Contract / `"use client"` ledger entry,
- `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, or a route shell became a large client-side blob instead of server root + small client islands,
- global providers/bootstrap import route-specific dashboards, injections, notifications, messages, payments, editors, calendars, graphs, or browser SDKs,
- bundle/runtime footprint grows without measurement, explanation, and explicit acceptance,
- changed interactions lack tests for hydration, accessibility, loading state, or error state,
- the client-boundary check output (if the project lists one in `framework.config.json` → `validation`) is missing for generated frontend/app-shell changes.

Add the client-boundary report and any bundle/RAM/per-route evidence to the review summary.

## Output Format

Use this structure for every review:

```markdown
# Code Review: {PR title or change description}

## Summary

{1-3 sentences: what the change does, overall assessment}

## CI/CD Verification

List one row per command in `framework.config.json` → `validation` (the example rows below are from one platform):

| Gate                                                    | Status         | Notes                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| `<validation command 1>` (e.g. `yarn build:packages`)   | PASS/FAIL      |                         |
| `<validation command 2>` (e.g. `yarn generate`)         | PASS/FAIL      |                         |
| `<validation command 3>` (e.g. rebuild)                 | PASS/FAIL      |                         |
| `<validation command 4>` (e.g. `yarn i18n:check-sync`)  | PASS/FAIL      |                         |
| `<validation command 5>` (e.g. `yarn i18n:check-usage`) | PASS/FAIL/WARN | (if non-blocking in CI) |
| `<validation command 6>` (e.g. `yarn typecheck`)        | PASS/FAIL      |                         |
| `<validation command 7>` (e.g. `yarn test`)             | PASS/FAIL      |                         |
| `<validation command 8>` (e.g. `yarn build:app`)        | PASS/FAIL      |                         |

## Findings

### Critical

{Violations that MUST be fixed before merge — security, data integrity, tenant isolation}

### High

{Architecture violations, missing required exports, broken conventions}

### Medium

{Style issues, missing best practices, suboptimal patterns}

### Low

{Suggestions, minor improvements, nits}

## Backward Compatibility

- [ ] No contract surface removed or renamed without deprecation bridge

- [ ] Code-generation/prepare command (from `framework.config.json` → `validation`) re-run after file additions
- [ ] No cross-module ORM relationships
- [ ] Encryption helpers used instead of raw `em.find`/`em.findOne` — grep diff for `em.findOne(` and `em.find(` in non-test files; every hit is a blocker
- [ ] Forms use `CrudForm`, tables use `DataTable`
- [ ] Non-`CrudForm` backend writes use `useGuardedMutation(...).runMutation(...)` with `retryLastMutation` in context

- [ ] Behavior changes covered by unit and/or integration tests (or explicitly justified as not applicable)
- [ ] No empty `catch` blocks (all catches must handle, log, rethrow, or explicitly document intentional ignore)
- [ ] New migrations are scoped to intended entities only (no unrelated bulk drop/alter/create statements)
- [ ] New or renamed spec files use `{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}.md` under the specs root (`framework.config.json` → `paths.specsRoot`, including any `enterprise/` subfolder)
- [ ] No two spec files collapse to the same normalized `{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}.md` target when legacy prefixed names (e.g. `SPEC-*` / `SPEC-ENT-*`) are removed
```

Omit empty severity sections. Mark passing checklist items with `[x]` and failing with `[ ]` plus explanation.

## Severity Classification

| Severity     | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                              | Action                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |

| **Low**      | Style suggestion, minor improvement, readability                                                                                                                                      | Nice to have          |

## Quick Rule Reference

These are the highest-impact rules. For the full checklist, see this skill's `references/review-checklist.md`.

### Backward Compatibility (Critical)

- **MUST NOT remove/rename** any contract surface (event IDs, spot IDs, API routes, type fields, function signatures, DI names, feature IDs, import paths, DB columns, convention file exports) — see the project's backward-compatibility contract (e.g. a `BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md`) for the full list
- **Deprecate first**: `@deprecated` JSDoc → bridge re-export/alias → removal after one minor version
- **Additive-only DB changes**: new columns with defaults OK; rename/remove/narrow columns is BREAKING
- **Event payloads**: may add optional fields; MUST NOT remove existing fields
- **Widget spot context**: may add optional fields; MUST NOT remove or change type of existing fields
- **API responses**: may add fields; MUST NOT remove existing fields
- **Any PR touching a contract surface** MUST reference a spec with a "Migration & Backward Compatibility" section

### Architecture (Critical/High)

- **NO direct ORM relationships between modules** — use FK IDs, fetch separately
- **Always filter by `organization_id`** for tenant-scoped entities — never expose cross-tenant data
- **Use DI (Awilix)** to inject services — never `new` directly
- **NO direct module-to-module function calls** for side effects — use events
- **Cross-module data**: use extension entities + `data/extensions.ts` — never add columns to another module's table

### Security (Critical)

- **Validate all inputs with zod** in `data/validators.ts` — never trust raw input
- **Use `findOneWithDecryption`/`findWithDecryption`** instead of raw `em.findOne`/`em.find` for ALL tenant-scoped entity queries in production code (not tests). This is a HARD BLOCKER — grep the diff for `em.findOne(` and `em.find(` in non-test files. Import from the shared encryption helper module (example imports: `@open-mercato/shared/lib/encryption/find` or `@open-mercato/shared/lib/data/encryption`).
- **Hash passwords with bcryptjs (cost >= 10)** — never log credentials
- **Auth endpoints**: return minimal error messages — never reveal if email exists
- **Every endpoint MUST declare guards** (`requireAuth`, `requireRoles`, `requireFeatures`)
- **Sensitive fields**: MUST define `fieldPolicy.excluded` in search config
- **MUST NOT cache** passwords, tokens, PII without encryption

### Data Integrity (Critical/High)

- **Migration files and snapshots must match entity intent** — prefer the project's migration-generation command, but scoped manual SQL is allowed when generation emits unrelated churn; in that case the module's ORM snapshot file (e.g. `.snapshot-<project>.json`) MUST be updated too.
- **Autogenerated migration sanity is mandatory** — generated files can be wrong; reviewers MUST validate migration diff scope
- **Use `withAtomicFlush`** when mutating entities across phases that include queries
- **Flush scalar changes BEFORE** relation syncs — avoid `__originalEntityData` reset
- **Workers/subscribers MUST be idempotent** — they may be retried
- **Commands MUST be undoable** — include before/after snapshots

#### Migration Sanity Gate (Critical)

For every migration in the diff, reviewer MUST:

1. Compare migration statements against the PR intent/spec and touched entities.
2. Flag as **Critical** if migration includes unrelated schema churn (especially mass `drop constraint`, `drop table`, or broad `alter table` across many modules).
3. Require regeneration/removal when scope is incorrect, even if file is autogenerated.
4. Block merge until migration contains only expected schema changes.

Examples of suspicious patterns that MUST be flagged:

- Migration touches many tables outside module scope for a focused feature PR.
- Migration mostly contains destructive statements (`drop`, bulk constraint removals) without matching entity changes.
- Snapshot/migration files appear due to local drift and are not required for feature behavior.

### Naming & Structure (High/Medium)

- Modules: **plural, snake_case** (folders and `id`)
- JS/TS identifiers: **camelCase**
- Database tables/columns: **snake_case**, table names plural
- Common columns: `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`, `is_active`, `organization_id`, `tenant_id`
- UUID PKs, explicit FKs, junction tables for many-to-many
- Code MUST NOT be added directly in the app's `src/` root — use the modules root (`framework.config.json` → `paths.modulesRoot`)
- The shared package (one platform's example: `@open-mercato/shared`) has **zero domain dependencies** — MUST NOT import from the core domain package (e.g. `@open-mercato/core`)

### Required Exports (High)

| File        | Required Export                                             | Rule                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API routes  | `openApi`                                                   | MUST export for doc generation                                                                     |
| API routes  | `metadata`                                                  | MUST declare auth guards                                                                           |
| Subscribers | `metadata` with `{ event, persistent?, id? }`               | MUST for auto-discovery                                                                            |
| Workers     | `metadata` with `{ queue, id?, concurrency? }`              | MUST for auto-discovery                                                                            |
| `events.ts` | `eventsConfig` via `createModuleEvents()` with `as const`   | MUST for type-safe events                                                                          |
| `acl.ts`    | `features`                                                  | MUST use object entries `{ id, title, module }` and mirror IDs in `setup.ts` `defaultRoleFeatures` |
| `search.ts` | `searchConfig` with `checksumSource` in every `buildSource` | MUST for change detection                                                                          |

### UI & HTTP (Medium/High)

- Forms: `CrudForm` — never custom form implementations
- If a backend page cannot use `CrudForm`, every write (`POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE`) MUST go through `useGuardedMutation(...).runMutation(...)`
- `useGuardedMutation` context MUST include `retryLastMutation` so conflict resolution can auto-retry without extra save prompts
- Tables: `DataTable` — never manual table markup
- Notifications: `flash()` — never `alert()` or custom toast
- API calls: `apiCall`/`apiCallOrThrow` — never raw `fetch`
- JSON reading: `readJsonSafe(response, fallback)` — never `.json().catch()`
- CRUD errors: `createCrudFormError(message, fieldErrors?)` — never raw throw
- Dialogs: MUST support `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` (submit), `Escape` (cancel)
- `RowActions` items MUST have stable `id` values (`edit`, `open`, `delete`)
- `pageSize` MUST be <= 100
- i18n: `useT()` client-side, `resolveTranslations()` server-side — never hardcode strings

### Code Quality (Medium)

- **No `any` types** — use zod + `z.infer`, narrow with runtime checks
- **No empty `catch` blocks** — catch blocks MUST handle, log, rethrow, or include explicit rationale for intentional ignore
- **No one-letter variable names**
- **No inline comments** — code should be self-documenting
- **Boolean parsing**: use the shared boolean helpers (example: `parseBooleanToken`/`parseBooleanWithDefault` from `@open-mercato/shared/lib/boolean`)
- **Prefer functional, data-first utilities** over classes
- **Don't add docstrings/comments/annotations** to code you didn't change

### Testing Coverage (High/Medium)

- **Behavioral changes MUST include test coverage** through unit tests, integration tests, or both
- **Risk-heavy paths MUST include integration coverage** (permissions, tenant isolation, workflows, billing, undo/redo, events)
- **Missing tests are findings**: report exact files/areas lacking coverage and list the tests to add
- **If tests are intentionally skipped**, reviewer MUST verify a documented rationale and residual risk

## Review Heuristics

When reviewing, pay special attention to:

0. **Backward compatibility**: For EVERY changed file, ask: "Does this touch a contract surface?" Check against the project's backward-compatibility contract (e.g. a `BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md`). If a type field is removed, a function signature changed, an event ID renamed, a spot ID removed, a DB column dropped, an import path moved, or a DI name changed — flag as **Critical** unless the deprecation protocol is followed (bridge + `@deprecated` + spec).
1. **New files added**: Check if the code-generation/prepare command (from `framework.config.json` → `validation`) needs to be re-run. Verify auto-discovery paths are correct.
2. **Entity changes**: Check if migration and snapshot updates are needed. Look for missing tenant scoping columns.
   2a. **Migration presence for entity changes**: If any entity schema file changed (for example `data/entities.ts`), verify the diff also contains a corresponding migration file or a documented no-op explanation, plus the module's ORM snapshot file when schema changed.
   2b. **Migration files**: Inspect SQL content, not only filename. Autogenerated does not mean valid; reject oversized/unrelated churn.
   2c. **Snapshot files**: Verify the ORM snapshot file represents the post-migration schema. Missing snapshot updates are blockers because they make a future migration-generation run recreate already-committed SQL.
3. **New API routes**: Verify `openApi` export, auth guards, zod validation, tenant filtering.
4. **Event emitters**: Verify event is declared in `events.ts` with `as const`. Check subscriber exists.
5. **Search config changes**: Verify `checksumSource`, `fieldPolicy.excluded` for sensitive fields, `formatResult` for token strategy.
6. **Cache usage**: Verify DI resolution, tenant scoping, tag-based invalidation on writes.
7. **Queue workers**: Verify idempotency, `metadata` export, concurrency <= 20.
8. **Commands**: Verify undoable, before/after snapshots, `withAtomicFlush` for multi-phase mutations.
9. **Setup changes**: Verify `defaultRoleFeatures` matches `acl.ts` features. Hooks MUST be idempotent.
   9a. **ACL shape validation**: Verify `acl.ts` exports feature objects (with `id`, `title`, `module`) rather than raw string IDs; flag wrong shape as **High** because permission UI and role assignment can break.
10. **UI changes**: Verify `CrudForm`/`DataTable` usage, `flash()` for feedback, keyboard shortcuts, loading/error states.
11. **Behavior changes**: Verify unit and/or integration tests cover new behavior, regressions, and edge cases.
12. **Mutation guard coverage**: For backend pages with manual save/delete logic (non-`CrudForm`), verify `useGuardedMutation` is wired for all writes and context includes `retryLastMutation`; for custom write API routes, verify `validateCrudMutationGuard` + `runCrudMutationGuardAfterSuccess` are both wired.
13. **Spec filename hygiene**: If specs were added or renamed, verify new files use `{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}.md`, legacy numbered files are not copied forward into new work, and no two files would resolve to the same normalized date+slug target.
14. **Template sync prompt**: If the project's template-sync check finds drift in `src/app` or `src/modules` (especially layout/routes), ask the user whether to sync; when approved, run the template-sync fix command and include those updates.

## Lessons Learned

Check these known pitfalls from the project's lessons file (e.g. `.ai/lessons.md`). The examples below are from one platform (a MikroORM-style EntityManager) — substitute your stack's equivalents:

1. **Stale snapshots in `buildLog()`**: Always load via forked `EntityManager` or `refresh: true`
2. **Lost updates on flush**: Flush scalar changes BEFORE relation syncs that query on same `EntityManager`
3. **Undo payload duplication**: Use a centralized `extractUndoPayload()` helper (example import: `@open-mercato/shared/lib/commands/undo.ts`)
