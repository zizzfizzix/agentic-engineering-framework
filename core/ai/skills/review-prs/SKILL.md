# Review PRs

Use this as a day-start review queue. It finds unreviewed open PRs, shows the queue, then runs the full `auto-review-pr` workflow one PR at a time.

## Workflow

### 1. Fetch open PRs

```bash
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,url,author,labels,reviewDecision,createdAt,updatedAt,isDraft,assignees --limit 50
CURRENT_USER=$(gh api user --jq '.login')
```

### 2. Filter to PRs that still need review

Labels referenced below come from `aef.config.json` → `git.labels`. Keep PRs where all of the following are true:

- not draft
- `reviewDecision` is empty or `REVIEW_REQUIRED`
- author is not `$CURRENT_USER`
- does not carry the `do-not-merge` or `blocked` label
- does not carry the `in-progress` label
- has no assignee other than `$CURRENT_USER`

### 3. Sort newest first

Most recently created PRs should be reviewed first.

### 4. Present the queue

```markdown
## Review Queue — {date}

Found {count} unreviewed PRs (newest first):

| #           | Title              | Author | Created | Labels              |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------ | ------- | ------------------- |
| [#456](url) | Add catalog search | @bob   | 2h ago  | `feature`, `review` |
```

### 5. Review sequentially

For each PR:

1. Print `Reviewing PR #{number}: {title} ({index} of {total})`
2. Run the full `auto-review-pr` skill workflow
3. Record the verdict
4. Continue to the next PR

Between PRs, report progress briefly:

```text
Reviewed {done}/{total}. Next: #{number}
```

### 6. Final summary

```markdown
## Review Session Complete

| #    | Title              | Verdict           | Label             |
| ---- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| #456 | Add catalog search | APPROVED          | merge-queue       |
| #445 | Fix auth redirect  | CHANGES REQUESTED | changes-requested |
```

If the queue is empty, say so and suggest running `merge-buddy` instead.

## Rules

- Never silently skip an eligible PR.
- If a PR cannot be reviewed right now, include the reason in the session summary and move on.
- Respect existing `in-progress` locks; never auto-force in batch mode.
- Reuse the full `auto-review-pr` skill rather than inventing a lighter review path.
- Optionally suggest `merge-buddy` after the session so the user can see what is now merge-ready.
