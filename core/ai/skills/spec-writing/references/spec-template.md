## Open Questions _(remove before finalizing)_

> **When to include**: Add this section to the skeleton when critical architectural decisions — data model shape, scope boundaries, integration points, or technology choices — cannot be inferred from the brief. List as `Q1`, `Q2`, … Keep each question short and answerable. **STOP and wait for answers before proceeding to Research/Design.**
> Once all questions are answered, fill in the spec and delete this section.

- **Q1**: [Critical unknown — e.g. "Should this store data per-tenant or globally?"]
- **Q2**: [Critical unknown — e.g. "Does this replace X or coexist with it?"]

## Risks & Impact Review

Document concrete risks across the categories below. For each feature, answer "what can go wrong," then record mitigations and residual risk.

### Data Integrity Failures

- What happens if the operation is interrupted mid-way (crash, timeout, network failure)? Is data left in an inconsistent state?
- Are there race conditions when multiple users modify the same entity concurrently? How are conflicts resolved?
- Can partial writes occur (e.g., parent created but child entities fail)? Are transactions used to ensure atomicity?
- What happens if referenced entities are deleted while this operation is in-flight (dangling foreign keys)?

### Cascading Failures & Side Effects

- Which other modules depend on this data? If this entity is corrupted or delayed, what breaks downstream?
- Does this feature emit events? What happens if a subscriber fails: block main operation, retry, or drop?
- Are there circular dependencies between modules that could cause loops or deadlocks?
- If an external service (email, payment, webhook) is unavailable, does the operation fail or degrade gracefully?

### Tenant & Data Isolation Risks

- Can a bug in this feature leak data between tenants? Describe the exact isolation boundary.
- Are there shared/global resources (caches, queues, counters) that could cause cross-tenant interference?
- What happens if a single tenant has far more data than others? Is noisy-neighbor impact bounded?

### Migration & Deployment Risks

- Can this change be deployed without downtime? Is migration backward-compatible?
- If migration fails halfway, can it be safely re-run or rolled back?
- Does this require data backfill? How long on millions of rows, and can traffic continue during backfill?
- Are there breaking API contract changes? How are existing clients protected?

### Operational Risks

- What monitoring/alerting gaps remain? How does on-call detect failure quickly?
- What is the blast radius if this feature fails entirely: isolated module or tenant-wide/system-wide effect?
- Are there rate-limiting/throttling concerns (bulk operations, event storms, notification floods)?
- What are storage growth implications at scale (audit logs, version history, generated artifacts)?

### Risk Register (Required Format)

Use this format for every explicit risk:

```markdown
#### [Risk Title]

- **Scenario**: What exactly goes wrong and under what conditions
- **Severity**: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- **Affected area**: Which modules, APIs, or user-facing features are impacted
- **Mitigation**: How the design addresses this (transaction boundaries, retry logic, circuit breaker, fallback)
- **Residual risk**: What remains unmitigated and why it is acceptable
```

## Final Compliance Report

Use this exact structure:

### Non-Compliant Items

For each non-compliant item:

- **Rule**: Exact rule text
- **Source**: Which AGENTS.md file
- **Gap**: What is missing or wrong
- **Recommendation**: Specific fix needed

### Verdict

- **Fully compliant**: Approved — ready for implementation
- **Non-compliant**: Blocked — items must be resolved before implementation
